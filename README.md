# CT60A2500 C-ohjelmoinnin perusteet
This is repository for my course I completed in LUT University while doing my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.

It contains my CT60A2500 C-ohjelmoinnin perusteet (Basics of C-Programming) course work. Which is worth 3 ECTS.


## Learning objectives

After completing the course, I am able to

    1. create small programs in the C programming language using basic commands, data structures, and libraries.
    
    2. develop a program composed of multiple subroutines and files, making the program easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
    
    3. use pointers and dynamic memory allocation to create and manage linked lists.
    
    4. use the make program for compiling programs.
